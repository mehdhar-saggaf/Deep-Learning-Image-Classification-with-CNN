# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification-with-CNN
# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project involves loading, preprocessing, and analyzing the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to explore and preprocess the data, visualize sample images, and build a machine learning model for classification.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualize 10 sample images from each class
- Train a classification model using deep learning
- Evaluate model performance
- Deploy the trained model for real-world usage

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras torch torchvision flask fastapi
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells to load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Train a classification model.
4. Evaluate the model and analyze the results.
5. Deploy the trained model using Flask or FastAPI.

## Dataset

- The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of images in 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
- Downloaded and preprocessed within the notebook.

## Model Training

- Uses deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for image classification.
- Implements training, validation, and testing processes.

## Model Deployment

- Deploys the trained model using Flask or FastAPI.
- Provides an API for real-time image classification.

## Results

- Displays accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualizes sample predictions and misclassified images.
